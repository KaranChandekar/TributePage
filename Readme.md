# TributePage

So, as a part of my 100 days of code challenge. I have created a webpage which is tribute for Dr. Norman borlaug. He is  American agricultural scientist, plant pathologist, and winner of the Nobel Prize for Peace in 1970. This webpage is created with HTML and CSS and its fully responsive. This project is taken from freeCodeCamp responsive web design course challenge! I am happy that I have completed it.
